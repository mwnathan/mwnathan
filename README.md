# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

my name is nathan and i am a year 10 student. I study to core subjects (english, maths, R.E etc) For my options i chose to study Geography,Business and IT. I chose geography because i enjoy learning it more that history, i chose business in case i want to become and entreprenuer in future and i chose IT because i think its the future and i think it will be usefull to learn if i wasnt to get ahed.

# Future
 In future i would like to work in either IT, Aeronautical engineering or piloting because they are jobs i would not get boared of.

# my experience so far with Commonwealth: 
During my work experience week i have been asigned with working in the commonwealth secretariat IT sector. i think it has been a really positive exprience as i have gained alot of knowledge on how everyones job here contributes to get solve a larger issue

## Kale:
With kale he showed me how he uses microsoft forms to gather information and export them to an excel document where the information given can be processed for example cash passports. We also went over how he uses visual studio to create temporary websites for clients.
## Felix:
With Felix we went over how he converts data from being complecated to being easy to read for others using power bi, on power bi we gathered data from an excel spreadsheet and was able to convert that data to a graph of personal design.
