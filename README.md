## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

my name is nathan and i am a year 10 student. I study to core subjects (english, maths, R.E etc) For my options i chose to study Geography,Business and IT. I chose geography because i enjoy learning it more that history, i chose business in case i want to become and entreprenuer in future and i chose IT because i think its the future and i think it will be usefull to learn if i wasnt to get ahed. In future i would like to work in either IT, Aeronautical engineering or piloting.
