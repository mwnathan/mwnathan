# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

my name is Nathan Mwangi, i am a year 10 student. I study to core subjects (English, Maths, R.E etc) For my options I chose to study Geography,Business and IT. I chose geography because I enjoy learning it more that history, i chose business in case i want to become and entreprenuer in future and I chose IT because I think its the future and I think it will be usefull to learn if I wasnt to get ahed.

# Future
 In future I would like to work in either IT, Aeronautical engineering or piloting because they are jobs I would not get bored of.

# my experience so far with Commonwealth: 
During my work experience week I have been assigned with working in the commonwealth secretariat IT sector. I think it has been a really positive experience as I have gained a lot of knowledge on how everyone's job here contributes solving a larger issue.
## Business process mapping:
With Fredrick we discussed business prosses mapping where he uses information given to him to design a solution, these solutions can be used to either save time or save money.
## Power apps basics:
With kale he showed me how he uses microsoft forms to gather information and export them to an excel document where the information given can be processed for example cash passports. We also went over how he uses visual studio to create temporary websites for clients. ![Alt text](FirstGraph.png) 
## Data analytics:
With Felix we went over how he converts data from being complecated to being easy to read for others using power bi, on power bi we gathered data from an excel spreadsheet and was able to convert that data to a graph of personal design.
## Data governance:
With Makoti he introduced me to github and how it is used to collaborate a team to complete objectives using Git while not using the same computer or a usb I also created an account for this repository.
